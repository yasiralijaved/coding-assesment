# coding-assesment
A C# based console project that contains a lot of small programs that can help you to assess your coding skills. Usually we face these code assessments in Speed Programming Competitions or online interview coding tests.
 
 Below is the list of coding questions that are solved in this project:

<hr />

***Program-1:***

Have the function LetterChanges(str) take the str parameter being passed and modify it using the following algorithm. Replace every letter in the string with the letter following it in the alphabet (ie. c becomes d, z becomes a). Then capitalize every vowel in this new string (a, e, i, o, u)cand finally return this modified string.

******Sample Test Cases******

| Input  | Output |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| hello*3  | Ifmmp*3  |
| fun times!  | gvO Ujnft!  |


<hr />

***Program-2:***

Have the function SimpleAdding(num) add up all the numbers from 1 to num. For example: if the input is 4 then your program should return 10 because 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10. For the test cases, the parameter num will be any number from 1 to 1000. 

******Sample Test Cases******

| Input  | Output |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 12  | 78  |
| 140  | 9870  |

<hr />

***Program-3:***

Have the function LetterCapitalize(str) take the str parameter being passed and capitalize the first letter of each word. Words will be separated by only one space. 

******Sample Test Cases******

| Input  | Output |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| hello world  | Hello World  |
| i ran there  | I Ran There  |
